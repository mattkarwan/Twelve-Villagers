Issues:

- Need to save the 3rd move so that rotation is fixed?
- Drop shadow being cut off at top of screen due to 10px offset
- Contrast on buttons isn't sufficient
- Change meeples.length to (let i = 0; let j = meeples.length; i < j; i++)
- Add option to view rules to the nav
- Make the nav invisible from the start
- Add hover effects to everything
- Make nav look more clickable
- Make rules and solution look consistent
- Make meeple holder invisible (also too dark rn)

IMPORTANT -- Change from alert if villager numbers aren't even
